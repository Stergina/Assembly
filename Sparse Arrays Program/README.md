# Sparse Arrays Program in MIPS32 Assembly


**Objective**:  
Implementing a program that displays a menu of options related to sparse array calculations in the symbolic language of the MIPS32 processor.

**Structure of the code**:  
Through the offered choices, the user is able to create two simple arrays by providing values through the keyboard. Moreover, user can convert those arrays into sparse arrays only by choosing the corresponding menu option. Also, there is an option of adding those two sparse arrays into a new sparse array. Lastly, there are also options for printing each of the sparse arrays calculated.
